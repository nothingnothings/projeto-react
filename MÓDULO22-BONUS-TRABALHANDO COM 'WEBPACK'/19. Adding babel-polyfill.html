<p>The current setup won't support all browsers theoretically supported by React. Features like Promises and <code>Object.assign()</code>&nbsp; are missing in older browsers - especially in IE of course.</p>

<p>If you need to support these browsers, you need to add a polyfill (a package which provides these features for older browsers). <code>babel-polyfill</code>&nbsp; is a great and easy-to-use choice.</p>

























<p>Add it like this:</p>

























<p><code>npm install --save babel-polyfill</code>&nbsp;</p>

























<p>Add the following import to the top of your index.js file:</p>

























<pre class="prettyprint linenums">import 'babel-polyfill';</pre>

















































<p>Change the config of your <code>env</code>&nbsp; babel preset in the <code>.babelrc</code>&nbsp; file:&nbsp;</p>























<pre class="prettyprint linenums">"presets": [
    ["env", {
        "targets": {
            "browsers": [
                "&gt; 1%",
                "last 2 versions"
            ]
        },
        "useBuiltIns": "entry"
     }],
     "stage-2",
     "react"
 ],</pre>















































<p><code>useBuiltIns</code>&nbsp; was added and by setting it to <code>'entry'</code>&nbsp;, the import in the <code>index.js</code>&nbsp; file (<code>import 'babel-polyfill'</code>&nbsp;) is actually changed to import whatever features need to be supported for your chosen browsers and environment.
