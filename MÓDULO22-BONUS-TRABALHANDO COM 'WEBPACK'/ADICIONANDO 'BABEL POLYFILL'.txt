The current setup won't support all browsers theoretically supported by React. Features like Promises and Object.assign()  are missing in older browsers - especially in IE of course.

If you need to support these browsers, you need to add a polyfill (a package which provides these features for older browsers). babel-polyfill  is a great and easy-to-use choice.

Add it like this:

npm install --save @babel/polyfill 

Add the following import to the top of your index.js file:

import 'babel-polyfill';
Change the config of your env  babel preset in the .babelrc  file: 

"presets": [
    ["env", {
        "targets": {
            "browsers": [
                "> 1%",
                "last 2 versions"
            ]
        },
        "useBuiltIns": "entry"
     }],
     "stage-2",
     "react"
 ],
useBuiltIns  was added and by setting it to 'entry' , the import in the index.js  file (import 'babel-polyfill' ) is actually changed to import whatever features need to be supported for your chosen browsers and environment.

EX:





PS C:\projeto2 - react\MÃ“DULO22-BONUS-TRABALHANDO COM 'WEBPACK'> npm install --save @babel/polyfill
npm WARN deprecated @babel/polyfill@7.12.1: ðŸš¨ This package has been deprecated in favor of separate inclusion of a polyfill and regenerator-runtime (when needed). See the @babel/polyfill docs (https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-polyfill) for more 
information.
npm WARN deprecated core-js@2.6.12: core-js@<3.3 is no longer maintained and not recommended for usage due to the number of issues. Because of the V8 engine whims, feature detection in old core-js versions could cause a slowdown up to 100x even if nothing is polyfilled. Please, upgrade your dependencies to the actual version of core-js.





(PARA USAR O ''BABEL POLYFILL''' COM CÃ“DIGO MAIS MODERNO,





vocÃª deve 

ESCREVER O SEGUINTE CÃ“DIGO 

__NO TOPO __ DO SEU ENTRY FILE ___ 


NO 

WEBPACK... (ou seja, 'index.js', no nosso caso...))--->



EX:



import "core-js/stable";
import "regenerator-runtime/runtime";



(colocar no topo de 'index.js').. ---> TAMBÃ‰M PRECISAMOS INSTALAR ESSAS 2 DEPENDENCIES...



INSTALEI O 

'core-js/stable'... (isso deu certo). --> E POR ALGUMA RAZÃƒO, O CÃ“DIGO DE ERRO RELATIVO 

a 

'regenerator-runtime' TAMBÃ‰M SUMIU... (isso pq esse PACKAGE passou a existir em 'node_modules'...)





-----------------------------------


OK, AGORA TENHO POLYFILL FUNCIONANDO, CREIO EU...
